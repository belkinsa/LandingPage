<h1>What is the “Sense of Openness”?</h1>

<p>Openness is referring to anything that falls into the Open * movements. Open Source and Open Science are two examples and are the two foci of the author of this blog, Svetlana Belkin .To her, being open is the best way to live our lifes. It allows us to see the world in different ways and allows us to understand the world.
</p>
<p>The sense part is referring to Svetlana’s feelings towards Open * movement. To her there are five senses that make up the whole sense and there are: sense of intuitiveness, sense of creativity, sense of freedom, sense of community, sense of empowerment.
